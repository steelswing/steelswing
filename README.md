## Best PROJECTS EVER

### [assimp4j](https://github.com/steelswing/assimp4j-52)
`assimp4j` is a Java wrapper library for importing various 3D model formats without the need for LWJGL 3. It provides a convenient way to load and process 3D models in Java applications.

- **Features:**
  - Supports multiple 40+ 3D-file-formats
  - Examples for loading static meshes.

### [capslang](https://github.com/steelswing/capslang)
`capslang` is a small Windows program that allows switching keyboard layouts using the Caps Lock key. When using a non-standard layout, the Scroll Lock indicator will light up.

- **Features:**
  - Switch keyboard layouts with Caps Lock.
  - Support for programs running as administrator.
  - Easy to install and use.

### [lib-gizmo-java](https://github.com/steelswing/lib-gizmo-java)
`lib-gizmo-java` is a Java library for creating interactive and customizable gizmos for 3D applications. It allows developers to easily integrate tools like transformers, manipulators, and other visual control elements.

- **Features:**
  - Support for various types of gizmos.
  - Integration with existing 3D engines and libraries.
  - Customizable parameters and behavior.

### [java-softwarerender-3d](https://github.com/steelswing/java-softwarerender-3d)
`java-softwarerender-3d` is a software-based 3D renderer written in Java. It provides the capability to render 3D scenes without hardware acceleration, making it ideal for educational purposes and experimentation.

- **Features:**
  - Rendering of 3D geometry and textures.
  - Support for basic graphics primitives and shaders.
  - Visualization using software algorithms.

### [perlin-worms](https://github.com/steelswing/perlin-worms)
`perlin-worms` uses Perlin noise to generate visually interesting and organic worm animations. This project demonstrates the application of procedural generators for creating animations and visual effects.

- **Features:**
  - Generation of animations using Perlin noise.
  - Parameterization and customization of worm behavior.
  - Visualization of organic movements and shapes.
